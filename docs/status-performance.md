# Status freshness and performance

Interactive status presents local Git results before cache identity checks or
GitHub fetches complete. Each completed remote section appears in the preview
while later requests are still running. The rotating cursor names the active
stage. Cleanup eligibility remains pending until PR evidence and local worktree
inspection finish. The final snapshot keeps the existing section order and
health checks. Redirected output remains a single unanimated snapshot.

The live preview fits within the terminal height, retains the header and newest
results, and notes omitted lines. Completion removes the preview and prints all
rows once. Ctrl-C cancels Git and GitHub subprocesses, removes the indicator,
restores the cursor, and exits with status 130. Available partial results remain
visible. GitHub fetches remain serial and keep their existing timeouts.

`gh x status` always reads local Git state. Working changes, branches, worktrees,
stashes and cleanup eligibility are never taken from the remote-data cache.
When the current worktree holds the default branch, its initial status result
also supplies the default-branch summary.

GitHub sections share a private cache in the repository's Git common directory.
Linked worktrees share it. Each repository/authentication/options/color key has
one atomic snapshot file, so a hit reads one file instead of scanning every
snapshot. Schema v5 replaces v4 without reading incompatible snapshots.

Each successful section is fresh for 60 seconds after its fetch completes.
Failures retain their existing unknown/error output and retry after five seconds.
A failed section does not invalidate successful sections or extend their original
freshness deadlines. Rate-limit errors wait at least 60 seconds; numeric
`Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` hints in the reported error extend that wait.
Healthy sections still refresh when they expire during a longer cooldown.
Writers take a nonblocking operating system file lock before merging and replacing
the snapshot. Each section keeps its newest fetch timestamp, data, errors and
retry deadline, including expired results. Pruning retains snapshots until their
latest section retry deadline, even across options or color changes. A contended writer skips publication;
readers continue using atomic snapshots without taking the lock.

`gh x status --refresh` explicitly bypasses these cached results and cooldowns.

The authentication fingerprint includes configuration, token overrides and
credential-store identities. GitHub CLI prefers a configured active token over
its keyring, so status does the same. Fallback-account keyring entries remain
fingerprinted because `gh auth token --user` prefers secure storage. Unknown
identities disable caching. No credential is written to either cache.

Automatic update checks cache successful release tags for one hour, separately
from repository data and under an authentication/host key. It includes the CLI
default API host and repository-derived fallback-account context. Run `gh x version`
to force a fresh release check. Cache failures never prevent the command from
running. `GH_X_CACHE_DIR` overrides the automatic-update cache root for isolated
fixtures; otherwise it uses the operating system's user cache directory.

A `GH_REPO` override keeps its explicit host, or lets GitHub CLI select the host
when unqualified. Otherwise status respects the locally selected repository host.

Set `GH_X_STATUS_DEBUG=1` to report `hit`, `miss`, `refresh`, `section-refresh`
or `identity-unavailable` on stderr. It reports no credential values.

Status shares one repository target and one branch-rules lookup across its PR
sections. The target retains the selected repository's host, including
`gh repo set-default`; unresolved local targets keep GitHub CLI's contextual
selection. It fetches issue relationships and hierarchy together while retaining
field-specific incomplete-data handling. It still makes requests serially.
If an older Enterprise schema rejects the hierarchy fields, status retries
relationships separately and keeps hierarchy data visibly unavailable.

The merged candidate query remains complete. Removing candidate check/review
fields needs a separate selection/enrichment design that preserves pagination,
Enterprise schema handling and actual merge-time ordering. Longer TTLs and
unbounded parallel requests were rejected because they trade freshness and
rate-limit reliability for lower measured latency.

## Acquisition comparison

The acquisition fixture also records `first_content_ms` separately from total
`ms`. It exercises terminal presentation with a deterministic 120-column,
40-row output sink. First content means the local repository header, excluding
the version banner and spinner. Real terminal captures measure process startup
separately. Existing total-duration and subprocess-count budgets still apply.

On Mini (Linux amd64, AMD Ryzen 5 7640HS, Go 1.26.7), the same populated fixture
at `a088800d9f560f15b883cf52719acb07689c4863` and this change produced these
seven-sample medians. Each GitHub transport call and keyring probe has a fixed
50 ms delay; local Git commands execute against a real temporary repository
with a linked worktree. The production dispatcher includes the automatic updater.

| Mode | Before ms | After ms | gh calls before/after | Git calls before/after | Keyring before/after | New cache outcome |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cold | 728.568 | 425.355 | 11 / 9 | 16 / 15 | 4 / 0 | miss |
| Warm | 119.313 | 16.842 | 1 / 0 | 12 / 11 | 2 / 0 | hit |
| Expired | 728.951 | 424.647 | 11 / 8 | 16 / 15 | 4 / 0 | miss |
| Forced refresh | 728.210 | 424.425 | 11 / 8 | 16 / 15 | 4 / 0 | refresh |
| Partial failure, within cooldown | 121.101 | 15.909 | 1 / 0 | 12 / 11 | 2 / 0 | hit |

Forced refresh improves by 41.7% on this fixture. Git counts cover the status
command seam; gh counts cover every transport invocation, including the updater,
and do not claim to count underlying HTTP pagination requests. Cold samples
empty both fixture-owned caches. Baseline partial-failure samples could reuse
an older successful snapshot; current tests require the failed section's error
to remain visible instead. These controlled timings are separate from real API
latency. See [benchmark instructions](../benchmarks/README.md) to reproduce them.
